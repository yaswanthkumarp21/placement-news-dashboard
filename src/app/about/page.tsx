        <p>
          {site.siteName} is a front page for {site.topic}. It watches a hand picked list of sources around the clock,
          groups what they publish into stories, ranks the stories by significance and freshness, and writes a one
          sentence plain language explainer under every headline. It is one page that shows what is happening right
          now, with no feed to scroll and no account to make.
        </p>
        <h2>Sections</h2>
        <p>
          Stories and podcasts are categorized across the areas of{" "}
          {sections.map((s, i) => (
            <span key={s.id}>
              {i > 0 ? (i === sections.length - 1 ? ", and " : ", ") : ""}
              <Link href={`/${s.id}`}>{s.title}</Link>

                {/* the tagline flows after the bolded name, so a function-word

          A story or podcast related to multiple areas can have two labels while roundup style content will appear in
          all.

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
          A pipeline runs around the clock. It reads the whitelisted sources and hands anything new to an editor
          model that decides what counts as news, merges coverage of the same event into one story, and files it under{" "}
          {sections.map((s, i) => (
            <span key={s.id}>
              {i > 0 ? (i === sections.length - 1 ? " or " : ", ") : ""}
              <Link href={`/${s.id}`}>{s.title}</Link>
            </span>
          ))}
          . The rules it applies are public on the <Link href="/criteria">criteria page</Link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the site is built from that. The <Link href="/stream">stream</Link> is the raw feed of accepted
          items. The <Link href="/archive/daily">daily archive</Link> freezes each day at UTC midnight. Clicking the
          date in the header opens any archived front page.

          {site.siteName} is also a remote MCP server. Point any MCP enabled assistant at{" "}
          <code>{siteUrl()}/api/mcp</code> and it can pull the top stories, the newest items, daily and weekly
          reviews, the podcasts, or search. The connection is read only and needs no account or key.
